            Hi, I'm Brett Kaplan, I am proud to be a Syracuse University, class of 2024, Newhouse/iSchool dual major with concentrations in graphic design and information management and technology. These studies reflect <strong>my strong interest in the intersection of art and technology,</strong> which has evolved into a passion for digital design. It is my goal to one day lead a creative team producing content, digital story-telling, and cultivating ideas for a new generation of media consumers.
        </p>
