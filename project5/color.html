    <p>The biggest power behind color is their ability to evoke emotions and make people feel things, but the color meaning in graphic design can seem confusing at first as colors often have different interpretations. Designers to not chose design aspects such as color by what simply looks “pretty.” Much thought goes into each decision as they as themselves a few questions. What will evoke these emotions? How can I get the viewer to see the bigger picture? Which shades will result in the greatest contrast?</p></div>
