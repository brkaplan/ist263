            Hi, I'm Brett Kaplan, a member of the class of 2024 at Syracuse University. I am a dual major in Newhouse and the iSchool. My concentrations are in graphic design, and information management, and technology. These studies reflect my interest in the <strong>intersection of art and technology. </strong>These have evolved into a passion for digital design and creation.
        </p>
         
         <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
         <p>
            In my free time, I love to create digital art for friends, family, and clients. This past summer, I worked as a design assistant for the company Overtime. Reporting to the lifestyle team, I was challenged with creating web graphics, apparel artwork, and Instagram content for @overtimefits.
        </p>
