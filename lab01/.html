    Hi, Im Brett Kaplan, a member of the class of 2024 at Syracuse University. I am a dual major in Newhouse and the iSchool. My concentrations are in graphic design, and information management, and technology. These studies reflect my interest in the intersection of art and technology. These have evolved into a passion for digital design and creation. In my free time, I love to create digital art for friends, family, and clients. This past summer, I worked as a design assistant for the company Overtime. Reporting to the lifestyle team, I was challenged with creating web graphics, apparel artwork, and Instagram content for @overtimefits.
