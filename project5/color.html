<h1>COLOR</h1>
<p>The biggest power behind color is their ability to evoke emotions and make people feel things, but the color meaning in graphic design can seem confusing at first as colors often have different interpretations. Designers to not chose design aspects such as color by what simply looks “pretty.” Much thought goes into each decision as they as themselves a few questions. What will evoke these emotions? How can I get the viewer to see the bigger picture? Which shades will result in the greatest contrast?</p>

<h2>Pantone is a color authority known to set standards in many industries worldwide.</h2>

    <P> Each year, designers are eager to find out which color will be crowned the color of the year by Pantone. Experts take this decision extremely seriously, considering several factors. These include upcoming events, innovations, and socio-economic factors. This year PANTONE 17-3938 ‘Very Peri’ has been titled the 2022 color of the year.</P>
    
    <p>Very Peri is a member of the blue family containing a violet, red undertone. The color is meant to enhance creativity and show off a lively attitude. It reflects the global transformation that has taken place. This year’s selection process differed from others as for 2022 it was decided to create a new shade rather than pick from an old one. Pre-existing colors struggled to reflect the dynamic world changes, meanwhile, Very Peri is a fresh and updated tone.</p>
    
    <p>As many industries have undertaken many changes through the covid era, the design industry follows these changes and incorporates them into their own products to stay current. Very Peri is reminiscent of the transition going on worldwide while showing off possibilities of technology.
