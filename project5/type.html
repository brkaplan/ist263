    <p>The art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader.
        Typography affects all of us. Viewers are constantly digesting these glyphs and turning them into phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. When used accurately, typography gives a final product true character and identity. An ordinary viewer might not realize the amount of time and effort put into design decision regarding type. However, ultimately the way type is expressed can illustrate differences in moods and trends. This is why typography is so crucial.</p>

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Typography dates to the 11th century. Even prior to digitalization typography was a craft associated with books and pamphlets. Modern day, typography can be found practically anywhere. From billboards to electronics. It is associated with both digital and print. The internet has only allowed typography to grow more as web designers have billions of typography decisions at their fingertips. This has allowed type to be more diverse than ever.</p>

    <h2>TYPEFACE VS. FONT</h2>
    <p>A typeface is often mistaken for a font; however, these terms are not meant to be used interchangeably. This difference can be found confusing to those, not in the design world. A typeface is a set of design features for glyphs (which is a character). Meanwhile, a font is a variation in the weight and size of a typeface.</p>

    <h2>PICKING FONT FAMILIES</h2>
    <p>The most important part when using type is to strategically choose treatments in design. This includes that less is more. Strong visual type uses a limited number of fonts. Most designers chose three max. In design, less is more. Additionally, it is important not to disrespect the integrity of a font distorting these are against the rules. This is because each font is specifically designed for usage and distortion destroys the harmony.</p>
